*This is a condensed overview of the Dai Credit System as defined in the “Purple Paper”: http://stablecoin.technology/purple.pdf. The Purple Paper is a formal specification and reference implementation that is modified by an RFC process.*

##Abstract

The Dai Credit System is a decentralized platform that backs the value of Dai: a cryptocurrency with price stability, that aims to become a new world currency. The Dai Credit System relies on MKR, a highly volatile digital asset that gives its holders financial exposure to the success and user adoption of Dai. MKR is also used for Risk Management of The Dai Credit System. The Zug, Switzerland-based Dai Foundation is responsible for the development of the Dai Credit System. Independent actors known as Keepers support the Dai Credit System through a variety of self-incentivized activities, such as arbitrage seeking, market making, closing under-collateralized CDPs and other utility services necessary for the operation of the Credit System. Keepers will offer Dai to the general market and to mainstream users, making it easy for anyone to use Dai as money without needing to understand the complex mechanisms that back Dai price stability.
 
##Introduction

Friedrich Hayek suggested that the most successful, privately issued money in an economy of competing private currencies would be the one with the most stable value, i.e. the one that has least volatility against a consumer price index. A cryptocurrency with price stability is a crucial component of the blockchain economy, because the majority of interesting Decentralized Applications require a stable medium of exchange to be usable. Popular cryptocurrencies and digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) are far too volatile to let individuals and businesses plan their activities appropriately with the confidence that the value that is in their wallet today will be roughly the value that is in their wallet tomorrow. As such it will be necessary to have a cryptocurrency with price stability before widespread adoption of blockchain technology can happen.

While there is a range of projects in the blockchain space aiming to create a cryptocurrency with price stability, the majority use a centralized custodian of the funds or some kind of trusted third party, which erases many of the benefits offered by the decentralized applications they are used on. Thus, for a price-stable cryptocurrency to fit coherently into the decentralized stack known as Web3[1], such a token must adhere to the principles of decentralization.

Since Dai is meant to be a global cryptocurrency, it cannot be 1:1 with an existing fiat currency. That is, because governments manipulate their own currencies to serve the needs of their citizens. Dai will instead be free-floating and slightly deflationary while using the Special Drawing Rights (SDR)[2] as an external reference for stability. The SDR can be manipulated by the International Monetary Fund, but it's designed to be less volatile.

##The Basic Mechanics & Economic Thesis of the Dai Credit System

Dai is a cryptocurrency that is backed by other digital assets as collateral. Any user can create Dai by borrowing against collateral they cryptographically lock inside The Dai Credit System. The Dai-denominated debt and collateral are contained in a smart contract called a Collateralized Debt Position. CDPs are owned by a users private key, and can be freely transferred to other users as if it was a digital asset, however CDP’s are not fungible with each other.

Usually only advanced users will use CDPs, and immediately after borrowing Dai with a CDP they will sell the Dai on the market to regular stability-seeking users who wish to obtain Dai for use as money. The CDP users do not want price stability, on the contrary they want to get leveraged exposure to the assets used as collateral in their CDP (see Example 2 below for an explanation on how leverage exposure is achieved with CDPs).

The solvency of The Dai Credit System is protected by a set of Risk Parameters, which are directly controlled by holders of the MKR digital asset through voting (One MKR gives one vote).

The price of Dai in the open market is kept stable around a variable Target Price, denominated in SDR. At launch the Target Price is initially set to be equal to approximately 1 USD (~0.75 SDR).

The stability of the Dai around the Target Price is maintained by modifying the incentives for borrowing and holding Dai via the Target Rate Feedback Mechanism. This is an automatic mechanism which absorbs some of the volatility of Dai and transfers the risk to the CDP users during periods of significant liquidity shortfalls. 

##Liquidation and Shoring-up Liquidity

To ensure there is always enough collateral in the system to cover the value of all outstanding Dai (according to the Target Price), a CDP can be Liquidated if it is deemed too risky. The Dai Credit System decides when to liquidate a CDP by comparing the Risk Parameter called the Liquidation Ratio with the collateral-to-debt ratio in the CDP. 

Each type of collateral asset has its own unique Liquidation Ratio controlled by MKR voters and decided based on the risk profile of that particular asset. The Dai Credit System continuously measures the market price of the collateral held in CDPs through Oracles, trusted external actors tasked with providing continuous price data.

Liquidation means that the Dai Credit System automatically buys the collateral of the CDP and subsequently sells it off in an automatic auction. 

In order for the system to take over the collateral of the CDP so it can be sold off, it first needs to raise enough Dai to cover the CDP debt. This is called a Debt Auction, and works by diluting the supply of the MKR digital asset and selling it to the bidders of the Debt Auction. A reverse bid mechanism is used to find the lowest amount of MKR that needs to be diluted in order to cover the CDP debt.

Simultaneously, the collateral of the CDP is sold off in a Collateral Auction where all proceeds (also denominated in Dai) up to the CDP debt amount plus a Liquidation Penalty (another Risk Parameter determined by MKR voting) is used to buy up MKR and remove it from circulation (counteracting the MKR dilution that happened during the Debt Auction). If enough Dai is bid to fully cover the CDP debt plus the Liquidation Penalty, the Collateral Auction switches to a reverse bid mechanism and tries to sell as little collateral as possible; any leftover collateral is returned to the original owner of the CDP.

During normal operation of The Dai Credit System, CDP’s continually accumulate a Stability Fee (the rate of accumulation is determined by the Stability Fee Risk Parameter). When a CDP is closed by the CDP user during normal operation, the Dai accumulated by the Stability Fee is used to perform "Buy&Burn", automatically buying up MKR from the market and permanently removing it from circulation. This results in a continuous cash flow from CDP users to MKR holders as long as the system remains solvent.

Liquidations aren't guaranteed to be profitable even if triggered when the collateral-to-debt ratio of the CDP is positive. Slippage during a market crash could cause the Collateral Auction to burn less MKR than what was diluted from the Debt Auction, resulting in net loss for MKR holders and a net increase of the MKR supply. 
Target Price, Target Rate, and the Sensitivity Parameter
The Dai Target Price is used to determine the collateral-to-debt ratio of a CDP, and thus the Target Price represents the price at which Dai is backed by collateral in the long term. The Target Price is continuously adjusted according to the current Target Rate. Automatic Target Rate adjustments continuously ensure that the Dai market price remains stabilized around the Target Price in the short term. 

When the market price of Dai is below the Target Price, the Target Rate increases, causing borrowing to become more expensive. This leads to CDP users covering their CDPs and leaving the ecosystem, causing the outstanding supply of Dai to decrease. At the same time, the increased Target Rate causes the capital gains from holding Dai to go up, leading to a corresponding increase in Dai demand. This combination of reduced supply and increased demand causes the Dai market price to increase, pushing it up towards the Target Price.

The same mechanism works in reverse if the Dai market price is higher than the Target Price: the Target Rate decreases, leading to an increased demand for borrowing Dai and a decreased demand for holding it. This causes the Dai market price to decrease, pushing it down towards the Target Price.

This mechanism is a negative feedback loop: Deviation away from the Target Price in one direction increases the force in the opposite direction. The magnitude of the Target Rate adjustments depends on how long the market price remains on the same side of the Target Price. Longer deviations result in aggressive adjustments, while shorter deviations result in small adjustments.

The Target Price and the Target Rate are entirely determined by market dynamics, and thus not directly controlled by MKR voters. They can only set the feedback mechanism’s Sensitivity Parameter. This parameter determines the magnitude target rate can change in response to Dai target/market price deviation, which allows tuning the rate of feedback to the scale of the system.

##Risk Management of The Dai Credit System

The MKR asset allows holders to vote to perform the following Risk Management actions:
Add new CDP type: Creates a new CDP type with a unique set of Risk parameters.
Modify existing CDP types: Change the Risk Parameters of one or more Existing CDP types that were already added.
Modify the Sensitivity Parameter.
Choose the set of trusted oracles. The Dai Credit System derives its internal prices for collateral and the market price of Dai based on the median of the set of trusted oracles. This ensures consistent operation of the system even in the event that up to half of the oracles suffer a technical failure.

##Risk Parameters

Collateralized Debt Positions of The Dai Credit System have multiple Risk Parameters. Each CDP Type has its own unique set of Risk Parameters, and these parameters are determined based on the risk profile of the collateral used by the CDP Type. The parameters are directly controlled by MKR holders through voting, with one MKR giving its holder one vote.

###Debt Ceiling

Debt ceiling is the maximum amount of debt that can be created by a single type of CDP. Once enough debt has been created by CDPs of a given type, it becomes impossible to create more unless existing CDPs are closed.
The debt ceiling is used to ensure sufficient diversification of the collateral portfolio.

###Liquidation Ratio

Liquidation ratio is the collateral-to-debt ratio at which a CDP becomes vulnerable to Liquidation. A low Liquidation Ratio means MKR voters expect low price volatility of the collateral, while a high Liquidation Ratio means high volatility is expected.

###Stability Fee

The Stability Fee is a fee paid by every CDP. It is defined as a yearly percentage that is calculated on top of the existing debt of the CDP. When the borrower covers their CDP, the Dai used to cover the CDP debt is destroyed, but the Dai used to pay the Stability Fee isn’t destroyed, instead it is sent to Buy&Burn.
A higher Stability Fee represents a higher expected rate of sudden death for the collateral (such as a hack or severe disaster instantly rendering the asset completely worthless).

###Penalty ratio

The penalty ratio is used to determined the maximum amount of Dai raised from a Liquidation Auction that goes to Buy&Burn, with excess collateral getting returned to the borrower who originally created the CDP. This is achieved with a two-way auction.
The penalty ratio is used to cover the inefficiency of the liquidation mechanism.

###Limbo Duration

A CDP enters limbo in the unlikely event that price information for collateral is not available (such as if all the oracles simultaneously suffer a technical failure). The limbo duration determines how long before all CDPs of that type are liquidated.

##Examples

**Example 1:** Bob wants to borrow 100 Dai. He locks an amount of ETH worth significantly more than 100 Dai into a CDP and uses it to borrow 100 Dai. The 100 Dai is instantly sent directly to his Ethereum account. Assuming that the Stability Fee is 1% per year, Bob will need 101 Dai to cover the CDP if he decides to retrieve his ETH after one year.

One of the primary use cases of CDPs is margin trading by borrowers.

**Example 2:** Bob wishes to go margin long on the ETH/Dai pair, so he borrows 100 SDR worth of Dai by posting 150 SDR worth of ETH to a CDP. He then buys another 100 SDR worth of ETH with his newly borrowed Dai putting him at a net 1.66x ETH/SDR exposure. He’s free to do whatever he wants with the 100 SDR worth of ETH he obtained by selling the Dai, while the original ETH collateral (150 SDR worth) remains locked until the debt plus the Stability Fee is covered.

Although CDPs are not fungible with each other, the ownership of a CDP is transferable. This allows CDPs to be used in smart contracts that perform more complex methods of borrowing (for example, involving more than one actor).

**Example 3:** Alice and Bob collaborate using an Ethereum OTC contract to issue 100 SDR worth of Dai backed by ETH. Alice contributes 50 SDR worth of ETH, while Bob contributes 100 SDR worth. The OTC contract takes the funds and creates a CDP, thus borrowing 100 SDR worth of Dai. The newly borrowed Dai are automatically sent to Bob. From Bob's point of view, he is buying 100 SDR worth of Dai by paying the equivalent value in ETH. The contract then transfers ownership of the CDP to Alice. She ends up with 100 SDR worth of debt (denominated in Dai) and 150 SDR worth of collateral (denominated in ETH). Since she started with only 50 SDR worth of ETH, she is now 3x long ETH/SDR.
Need some bridging / context here, this is from when I copy/pasted the examples into one section. Examples 3 and 4 are not related.

**Example 4:** If we assume that Ether has a liquidation ratio of 145%, a penalty ratio of 105%, and an Ether-CDP is outstanding at 150% collateral ratio, the Ether price crashes 10% against the Target Price. This causes the collateral ratio of the CDP to fall to ~135%. As it falls below its liquidation ratio, traders can trigger its liquidation and begin bidding with Dai for buying MKR in the debt auction. Traders can also begin bidding with Dai for buying the ~135 Dai worth of collateral in the collateral auction. Once there is at least 105 Dai being bid on the Ether collateral, traders reverse bid to take the least amount of collateral for 105 Dai and the remainder is returned to the original borrower.

## Keepers: Keeping the system rational and economically efficient
A keeper is an independent actor that is incentivized by profit opportunities to contribute to decentralized systems. In the context of The Dai Credit System, keepers participate in the Debt Auctions and Collateral Auctions when CDP are liquidated, and the Buy&Burn auctions that continuously happen during normal operation of the system.

Keepers also trade Dai around the Target Price. Keepers will want to sell Dai when the market price is higher than the Target Price. Similarly, keepers buy Dai when the market price is below the Target Price. This is in order to profit from the expected long-term convergence towards the Target Price.

##Oracles: Providing Price Feeds

Another crucial group of external actors that Maker requires to function are price feed oracles. Oracles are independent external actors or decentralized applications that provide a data feed onto the blockchain for smart contracts to consume. The Dai Credit System needs information about the market price of the Dai and its deviation from the Target Price in order to adjust the target rate. It also needs information about the market price of the assets used as collateral in CDPs, in order to know when liquidations should be triggered.

##Development Road Map
The Dai Credit System has been in development since March 2015 when it was announced under the name eDollar. [1] The Dai Foundation currently intends to launch the SimpleCoin research platform by Q2-2017 with the purpose of creating a simplified and controlled environment for testing the market dynamics that will be present in The Dai Credit System. For a detailed breakdown of future plans and tentative deadlines, please see the Maker blog post regarding the comprehensive Product Roadmap.[2]
 
##Design Goals
The current design of The Dai Credit System is the result of almost 2 years of iterations on the concept of a cryptocurrency with price stability backed by digital assets as collateral. We take every opportunity we see to make reductions and simplifications based on things that are theoretically equivalent under an economic incentive analysis. For example, cash flow to MKR holders is represented as Buy&Burn rather than dividends, as their economic impact is equivalent but Buy&Burn is less complex to implement with smart contracts. This later ended up yielding returns when it enabled us to massively simplify the CDP lifecycle and liquidation processes.
Another design goal was to ensure all operations were constant space and time. This introduced some challenges as the system simulates multiple sets of continuously growing or shrinking balances and most state is actually function of multiple real-time variables.

##Addressable Market
The Economist F.A. Hayek once theorized that the most successful, privately issued money in an economy of competing private currencies would be the one with the most stable value, i.e. the one that has least volatility against a consumer price index.[3] This means that Dai will have an important edge in achieving mass adoption when compared to other cryptocurrencies without price stability, such as Bitcoin or Ether. The following is a short non-exhaustive list of some of the immediate markets for The Dai Credit System (both in its capacity as a cryptocurrency with price stability, and its use case as a decentralized credit platform):

**Prediction Markets & Gambling Applications:** It is logical to not want to increase one’s risk by placing a bet with a volatile cryptocurrency. Especially long term bets become infeasible if the user also has to gamble on the future price of the volatile asset. Instead a cryptocurrency with price stability, like Dai, will be the natural choice for prediction market and gambling users.

**Financial Markets: Hedging, Derivatives, Leverage etc:** Dai will allow for easier leveraged trading. The asset will also be useful as collateral in custom derivate smart contracts, such as options or CFD’s.

 **Merchant receipts, Cross-border transactions and remittances:** Forex volatility reduction and lack of middlemen means the transaction costs of international trade can be significantly reduced by using Dai.
 
##Primary Risks and their Mitigation
 
###Malicious hacking attack against the smart contract infrastructure

The greatest risk to the system during its early stages is the risk of a malicious programmer finding an exploit in the deployed smart contracts, and using it to break or steal from the system before the vulnerability can be fixed. Worst case scenario all decentralized digital assets that are held as collateral in The Dai Credit System such as Ether or Augur Reputation could be stolen without any chance of recovery. The part of the collateral portfolio that is not decentralized, such as Digix Gold IOU’s, would not be stolen in such an event because they can be frozen and controlled through a centralized backdoor.

**Mitigation:** During the early stages of deployment, The Dai Credit System will have emergency security features that allows oracles to enact global settlement of the system if they detect a security breach. Global settlement will mean that all dai is destroyed, and dai holders are automatically transferred digital assets from the CDPs with a value equal to the Target Price of the dai they were holding (with the leftover collateral going to CDP users, as if their CDP had been liquidated). This feature will mean the system can deflect attacks that allow the attacker to slowly drain assets out of the smart contracts, but does not defend against attacks that allow the attacker to instantly drain all the collateral at once.

The more general and long term mitigation strategy is to invest heavily in an in-house team of world class programmers who specialize in developing secure smart contracts while also continuously performing independent security audits in parallel. Contract security and best practices has been the highest priority of the Dai development effort since its inception, and currently the codebase has already undergone two independent security audits by some of the best security researchers in the blockchain industry.

In the very long term, the risk of getting hacked can theoretically be completely mitigated through formal verification of the code, which means using functional programming to mathematically prove that the codebase does not contain exploit. While complete formal verification is a very long term goal, significant work towards it has already been done, including creating a full implementation of The Dai Credit System in the functional programming language Haskell.

###Black Swan Event in one or more Collateral assets
The highest impact risk is a potential Black Swan event on collateral used for the Dai, possibly in the early stages of Dai Credit System or prior to a point where MKR is robust enough to support inflation moments or a moment where the Dai Credit system supports a diverse portfolio of collateral.

**Mitigation:** CDP collateral will be limited to ETH in the early stages and the debt ceiling will be limited initially and will grow over time. Also, simple coin should provide pertinent lessons learned potentially including new Stability Levers.
 
###Competition & The Importance of Ease-of-Use
As mentioned above, there is a lot of money and brainpower working on cryptocurrency with price stability in the blockchain industry. By virtue of having “true decentralization”, The Dai Credit System is by far the most complex model and we may see a movement among cryptocurrency users where the ideals of decentralization are exchanged for the simplicity and marketing of centralized digital assets.

**Mitigation:** We expect that Dai will actually be quite easy to use for regular a crypto-user. The token will be a standard Ethereum token and easily available with high liquidity across the ecosystem. 

We will also invest heavily in core branding and international educational material during the initial launch of the system, and if resources permit it, the Dai Foundation will use the surplus of its MKR holdings on charity projects, which if done correctly and on a large enough scale, will guarantee positively biased exposure in mainstream media.

The complexities of the Dai Credit System will need to be understood primarily by Keepers and sophisticated capital investment companies that use the Dai Credit System for advanced financial purposes. While we appreciate that The Dai Credit System can be difficult to understand for the laymen, it is not impossible to grasp and most individuals interested in cryptocurrency won’t need to understand all of the components of the system, similarly to the fact that most Ether holders don’t understand the complexities of Ethereum.
 
###Pricing Errors, Irrationality & Unforeseen Events

A number of unforeseen events could potentially occur such as a problem with the price feed from the Oracles or other unexpected event such as irrational market dynamics that cause variation in the value of Dai for an extended period. If confidence is lost in the system, the deflation rate adjustment or even MKR dilution could hit extreme levels and still not bring liquidity and stability to the market.

**Mitigation:** The Maker community will need to incentivize a sufficiently large capital pool to act as Keepers of the market in order to maximize rationality and market efficiency as well as grow the Dai Credit System gradually at a steady pace. The Dai Foundation will also deploy its large capital reserves to act as a keeper, and this should ensure that even in the complete absense of any other well capitalized keepers in the early stages of the system, the Dai Foundation alone will be enough to keep the system rational.

##Conclusion
The Dai Credit System was designed to solve the crucial problem of stable exchange of value in the Ethereum ecosystem and wider blockchain economy. We believe that the mechanism through which Dai is created, transacted and retired along with the direct Risk Management by MKR holders allows for self-interested Keepers to maintain the price stability of Dai over time in an efficient manner. Early economic modelling has resulted in positive feedback around this hypothesis and we expect the SimpleCoin research platform to yield even more informative data points. The founders of The Dai Credit System have established a prudent governance roadmap that is appropriate for needs of agile development in the short term but also coherent with the ideals of decentralization over time. The development roadmap is aggressive and focused on widespread adoption of Dai in a responsible fashion. We are excited about the prospects of The Dai Credit System and hope to get feedback and contribution from the entire blockchain community, as it will be crucial in realizing such a grand project.
